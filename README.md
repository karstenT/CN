# CN - Corpus Nummorum
We based our work on the coin data that had been collected within the Corpus Nummorum Thracorum (CNT) project funded by the DFG. 
The CNT database contains a virtual meta-collection of ancient coins of Thrace, a region which covers modern Bulgaria, Northern 
Greece and European Turkey. The database consists of data about Thracian coins located in museums and private collections from 
all over the world. By analyzing these coins, coin dies have been reconstructed if possible. The goal of CNT is to generate a 
typology of Thracian coins. The iconography of these coins is described in human language. A description of the reverse and 
obverse of each coin is given both in English and German.
